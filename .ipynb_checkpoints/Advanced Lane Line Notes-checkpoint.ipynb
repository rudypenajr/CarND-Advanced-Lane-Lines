    "\n",
    "Image distortion occurs when a camera looks at 3D objects in the real world and transforms them into a 2D image. Distortion actually changes what the shape and size of these 3D objects appear to be. So the **first step** in analyzing camera images is to undo this distortion so that you can get correct and useful information."

    "#### Type of Distortions\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Radial Distortion:** Real cameras use curved lenses to form an image, and light rays often bend a little to much or too little as the edges of these lenses. This creates an effect that distorts the edges of images, so that lines or objects appear more or less curved than they actually are.\n",
    "* **Tangential Distortion:** Occurs when a camera's lens is not aligned perfectly parallel to the imaging plane, where the camera film or sensor is. This makes the image look tilted so that some objects appear farther away or closer than they actually are."
